SvgZoomInterface
================

SVG is great to make clickable graphic interfaces, but on small touch screens, where the precision of the cursor is lacking, selecting smaler areas can be difficult. Therefore zooming is needed. In this example we will show two methods of zooming. One is by having a controller that zooms onto selected areas and the other is a classical pinch-zoom interface, optimised for SVGs, so it does viewport zooming, whch keeps the SVG sharp and crisp.
